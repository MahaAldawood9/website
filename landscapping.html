            <!-- This mosque design was focused on sustainable residential and community
            buildings. The design reinterprets traditional Islamic architecture through a contemporary lens. As part of a broader effort to develop
            eco-conscious community spaces, the project integrates passive cooling strategies and low-impact materials.
            Two design proposals were explored: one minimalist and modern, the other rooted in traditional forms and
            ornamentation. -->
